As human beings it is our right (maybe our moral duty) to reshape the universe to our preferences
    - Technology, which is really [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beginning_of_Infinity), enable this
    - You should probably work on raising the ceiling, not the floor

Enthusiasm matters!
    - It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you
    - It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason
    - Energy is a necessary input for progress

It's important to do things fast
    - You learn more per unit time because you make contact with reality more frequently
    - Going fast makes you focus on what's important; there's no time for bullshit
    - "Slow is fake"
    - A week is **2%** of the year
    - Time is the denominator

Manage processes instead of people
    - Freedom with accountability and responsibility
    - Saves time to focus on something else
    - A better way to build knowledge base

Smaller teams are better
    - Faster decisions, fewer meetings, more fun
    - No need to chop up work for political reasons
    - No room for mediocre people (can pay more, too!)
    - Many tech companies are **overstaffed**

Where do you get your dopamine?
    - The answer is predictive of your behavior
    - Better to get your dopamine from improving your ideas than from having them validated
    - It's ok to get yours from "making things happen"

You can do more than you think
    - We are tied down by invisible orthodoxy
    - The laws of physics are the only limit

Character and actions play important role!
    - Determinants of your fate
    - Impact the way you live your life
