As opposed to what the acronyms suggests, the RICE model is not related to a food item. It is an easy to implement, yet a ruthless prioritization model which relies solely on data to combine prioritization factors in a consistent manner.

RICE model can be used to assign numerical values to each item in a product backlog. The higher the RICE number for an item, the more value it will provide to the end user. To understand how RICE works, the following is a quick and easy demonstration to learn it in a few minutes:

<div>
<p></p>
</div>

<ImageCarousel
  images={[one, two, three, four, five, six, seven]}
/>
